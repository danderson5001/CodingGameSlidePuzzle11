# CodingGame.com SlidePuzzle-11
Using the website codingGames.com I solved a slide puzzle with 11 tiles and one emptyspot. 


## Author: Duffy Anderson
## Due Date: 1/11/22
## Purpose: use A* to solve the puzzle. 
## Note: This project had a 10 or so line code of seed and a game layout and prompt that I will link to at the end of this file. I only passed 25 out of 38 tests but still pretty good. And Im proud of what I managed to accomplish in so little time.
